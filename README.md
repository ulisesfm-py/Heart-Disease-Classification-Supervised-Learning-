# Heart Disease Classifier

Welcome to the Heart Disease Classifier project! This repository is dedicated to developing a heart disease classification model using supervised learning techniques. The project leverages popular Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to preprocess data, build models, and visualize results.

## Introduction

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early and accurate detection through data analysis and machine learning can play a critical role in improving patient outcomes. This project aims to create a robust classification model that can predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes.

In this project, we will:
- Explore and preprocess a heart disease dataset.
- Develop and evaluate multiple supervised learning models.
- Visualize the performance of these models to gain insights into their accuracy and reliability.

This project is a starting point for building an effective heart disease classifier, with further enhancements and optimizations to be added as development progresses.
